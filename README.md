# Historic Conflict Data Analysis (WW2)

This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning approach to World War II battles. Using structured battle data stored in a PostgreSQL database, we uncover historical insights, visualize trends, and even build a model to predict the outcome of a battle.

### 📈 EDA Highlights
- Total soldiers and casualties distribution via pie charts
- Yearly trends in battles and casualties
- Battle terrain analysis and duration patterns
- Military involvement breakdowns
- Geographic battle density using a heatmap (static image)
  
### 🧠 Machine Learning
- Predicts the likely winner (Allied or Axis) of a battle
- Models used:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
  - **XGBoost Classifier**
- Random Forest showed better performance on this dataset (~79% accuracy)
